Recognizing gestures drawn with a mouse or a graphic tablet using a neural network trained with the Backpropagation algorithm.

Project contains 40 learning exaples along with an application used for collecting the data. All exaples were drawn by a single prerson
using a graphic tablet and represent one of the following greek letters: alpha, beta, gamma or epsilon.

The application for gesture recognition enables setting the parameters of the neural network and traning the network on the examples in the
learningExamples directory. It also enables testing the network by drawing one of the gestures on an empty canvas and calculating the output
of the network.
